            <h1 class="h1">DESIGN IDEOLOGY</h1>
            <h5 class="h5">Architecture to me is based on a number of cosmic principles-Functionality and
                Aesthetics, being the primary. After a thorough understanding of the userâ€™s
                psychology, the design of a space should be true to its function while at the same
                time creative enough to keep the targeted senses of the user engaged, and
                contended. I want my designs to simplify the lives of all the immediate and
                intermediate users, adding comfort and nurturing smiles while I continue with my
                possible contribution to the society by creating opportunities for employment striving
                harder to leave a mark on the skyline.</h5>
